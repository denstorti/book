== Aggregates and Consistency Boundaries

In this chapter we'd like to revisit our domain model to talk about invariants
and constraints, and see how our domain objects can maintain their own
internal consistency, both conceptually and in persistent storage.  We'll
discuss the concept of a _consistency boundary_, and show how making it
explicit can help us to build high-performance software without compromising
maintainability.

<<maps_chapter_06>> shows a preview of where we're headed: we'll introduce
a new model object called `Product` to wrap multiple batches, and make
the old `allocate()` domain service available as a method on `Product` instead.

=== Why Not Just Run Everything in a Spreadsheet?

What's the point of a domain model, anyway? What's the fundamental problem
we're trying to address?

Couldn't we just run everything in a spreadsheet? Many of our users would be
delighted by that. Business users _like_ spreadsheets because they're simple,
familiar, and yet enormously powerful.

In fact, an enormous number of business processes do operate by manually sending
spreadsheets back and forth over email. This "CSV over SMTP" architecture has
low initial complexity but tends not to scale very well because it's difficult
to apply logic and maintain consistency.

// IDEA: better examples?

Who is allowed to view this particular field? Who's allowed to update it? What
happens when we try to order –350 chairs, or 10,000,000 tables? Can an employee
have a negative salary?

These are the constraints of a system. Much of the domain logic we write exists
to enforce these constraints in order to maintain the invariants of the
system. The _invariants_ are the things that have to be true whenever we finish
an operation.


=== Invariants, Constraints, and Consistency

The two words are somewhat interchangeable, but a _constraint_ is a
rule that restricts the possible states our model can get into. An _invariant_
is defined a little more precisely, as a condition that is always true.

If we were writing a hotel-booking system, we might have the constraint that double
bookings are not allowed. This supports the invariant that a room cannot have more
than one booking for the same night.

Of course, sometimes we might need to temporarily _bend_ the rules. Perhaps we
need to shuffle the rooms around because of a VIP booking. While we're moving
bookings around in memory, we might be double booked, but our domain model
should ensure that, when we're finished, we end up in a final consistent state,
where the invariants are met. If we can't find a way to accommodate all our guests,
we should raise an error and refuse to complete the operation.

Let's look at a couple of concrete examples from our business requirements; we'll start with this one:

[quote, The business]
____
An order line can be allocated to only one batch at a time.
____

This is a business rule that imposes an invariant. The invariant is that an
order line is allocated to either zero or one batch, but never more than one.
We need to make sure that our code never accidentally calls `Batch.allocate()`
on two different batches for the same line, and currently, there's nothing
there to explicitly stop us from doing that.


==== Invariants, Concurrency, and Locks

Let's look at another one of our business rules:

[quote, The business]
____
We can't allocate to a batch if the available quantity is less than the
  quantity of the order line.
____

Here the constraint is that we can't allocate more stock than is available to a
batch, so we never oversell stock by allocating two customers to the same
physical cushion, for example. Every time we update the state of the system, our code needs
to ensure that we don't break the invariant, which is that the available
quantity must be greater than or equal to zero.

In a single-threaded, single-user application, it's relatively easy for us to
maintain this invariant. We can just allocate stock one line at a time, and
raise an error if there's no stock available.

This gets much harder when we introduce the idea of _concurrency_. Suddenly we
might be allocating stock for multiple order lines simultaneously. We might
even be allocating order lines at the same time as processing changes to the
batches themselves.

We usually solve this problem by applying _locks_ to our database tables. This
prevents two operations from happening simultaneously on the same row or same
table.

As we start to think about scaling up our app, we realize that our model
of allocating lines against all available batches may not scale. If we process
tens of thousands of orders per hour, and hundreds of thousands of
order lines, we can't hold a lock over the whole `batches` table for
every single one--we'll get deadlocks or performance problems at the very least.


=== What Is an Aggregate?

OK, so if we can't lock the whole database every time we want to allocate an
order line, what should we do instead? We want to protect the invariants of our
system but allow for the greatest degree of concurrency. Maintaining our
invariants inevitably means preventing concurrent writes; if multiple users can
allocate `DEADLY-SPOON` at the same time, we run the risk of over-allocating.

On the other hand, there's no reason we can't allocate `DEADLY-SPOON` at the
same time as `FLIMSY-DESK`. It's safe to allocate two products at the
same time because there's no invariant that covers them both. We don't need them
to be consistent with each other.

The _Aggregate_ pattern is a design pattern from the DDD community that helps us
to resolve this tension. An _aggregate_ is just a domain object that contains
other domain objects and lets us treat the whole collection as a single unit.

The only way to modify the objects inside the aggregate is to load the whole
thing, and to call methods on the aggregate itself.

As a model gets more complex and grows more entity and value objects,
referencing each other in a tangled graph, it can be hard to keep track of who
can modify what. Especially when we have _collections_ in the model as we do
(our batches are a collection), it's a good idea to nominate some entities to be
the single entrypoint for modifying their related objects. It makes the system
conceptually simpler and easy to reason about if you nominate some objects to be
in charge of consistency for the others.

For example, if we're building a shopping site, the Cart might make a good
aggregate: it's a collection of items that we can treat as a single unit.
Importantly, we want to load the entire basket as a single blob from our data
store. We don't want two requests to modify the basket at the same time, or we
run the risk of weird concurrency errors. Instead, we want each change to the
basket to run in a single database transaction.

We don't want to modify multiple baskets in a transaction, because there's no
use case for changing the baskets of several customers at the same time. Each
basket is a single _consistency boundary_ responsible for maintaining its own
invariants.

[quote, Eric Evans, DDD blue book]
____
// We need an abstraction for encapsulating references within the model.
An AGGREGATE is a cluster of associated objects that we treat as a unit for the
purpose of data changes.
// Each AGGREGATE has a root and a boundary. The boundary
// defines what is inside the AGGREGATE. The root is a single, specific ENTITY
// contained in the AGGREGATE. The root is the only member of the AGGREGATE that
// outside objects are allowed to hold references to, although objects within the
// boundary may hold references to each other. ENTITIES other than the root have
// local identity, but that identity needs to be distinguishable only within the
// AGGREGATE, because no outside object can ever see it out of the context of the
// root ENTITY.
____

Per Evans, our aggregate has a root entity (the Cart) that encapsulates access
to items. Each item has its own identity, but other parts of the system will always
refer to the cart as only an indivisible whole.

TIP: Just as we sometimes use pass:[<code><em>_leading_underscores</em></code>] to mark methods or functions
    as "private," you can think of aggregates as being the "public" classes of our
    model, and the rest of the entities and value objects are "private."

=== Choosing an Aggregate

What aggregate should we use for our system? The choice is somewhat arbitrary,
but it's important. The aggregate will be the boundary where we make sure
every operation ends in a consistent state. This helps us to reason about our
software and prevent weird race issues. We want to draw a boundary around a
small number of objects—the smaller, the better, for performance—that have to
be consistent with one another, and we need to give it a good name.

The object we're manipulating under the covers is `Batch`. What do we call a
collection of batches? How should we divide all the batches in the system into
discreet islands of consistency?

We _could_ use `Shipment` as our boundary. Each shipment contains several
batches, and they all travel to our warehouse at the same time. Or perhaps we
could use `Warehouse` as our boundary: each warehouse contains many batches,
and counting all the stock at the same time could make sense.

Neither of these concepts really satisfies us, though. We should be able to
allocate `DEADLY-SPOONs` and `FLIMSY-DESKs` at the same time, even if they're in the
same warehouse or the same shipment. These concepts have the wrong granularity.

When we allocate an order line, we're interested only in batches
that have the same SKU as the order line. Some sort of concept like
`GlobalSkuStock` could work: a collection of all the batches for a given SKU.

It's an unwieldy name, though, so after some bikeshedding via `SkuStock`, `Stock`,
`ProductStock`, and so on, we decided to simply call it `Product`—after all, that was the first concept we came across in our exploration of the
domain language back in <<chapter_01_domain_model>>.

So the plan is this: when we want to allocate an order line, instead of
<<before_aggregates_diagram>>, where we look up all the `Batch` objects in
the world and pass them to the `allocate()` domain service...

of all the batches _for that SKU_, and we can call a `.allocate()` method on that
instead.

// IDEA (hynek): random nitpick: exceptions denoting errors should be

NOTE: This `Product` might not look like what you'd expect a `Product`
    model to look like.  No price, no description, no dimensions.
    Our allocation service doesn't care about any of those things.
    This is the power of bounded contexts; the concept
    of a product in one app can be very different from another.
    See the following sidebar for more
    discussion.


//IDEA: talk about magic methods on aggregates maybe?  ie, a non-aggregate entity

[[bounded_contexts_sidebar]]
.Aggregates, Bounded Contexts, and Microservices
*******************************************************************************
One of the most important contributions from Evans and the DDD community
is the concept of
https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BoundedContext.html[_bounded contexts_].

In essence, this was a reaction against attempts to capture entire businesses
into a single model. The word "customer" means different things to people
in sales, customer service, logistics, support, and so on. Attributes
needed in one context are irrelevant in another; more perniciously, concepts
with the same name can have entirely different meanings in different contexts.
Rather than trying to build a single model (or class, or database) to capture
all the use cases, it's better to have several models, draw boundaries
around each context, and handle the translation between different contexts
explicitly.

This concept translates very well to the world of microservices, where each
microservice is free to have its own concept of "customer," and rules for
translating that to and from other microservices it integrates with.

In our example, the allocation service has `Product(sku, batches)`,
whereas the ecommerce will have `Product(sku, description, price, image_url,
dimensions, etc...)`. As a rule of thumb, your domain models should only
include the data that they need for performing calculations.

Whether or not you have a microservices architecture, a key consideration
in choosing your aggregates is also choosing the bounded context that they
will operate in. By restricting the context, you can keep your number of
aggregates low and their size manageable.

Once again, we find ourselves forced to say that we can't give this issue
the treatment it deserves here, and we can only encourage you to read up on it
elsewhere. The Fowler link earlier is a good starting point, and either
(or indeed, any) DDD book will have a chapter or more on bounded contexts.

*******************************************************************************


=== One Aggregate = One Repository

Once you define certain entities to be aggregates, we need to apply the rule
that they are the only entities that are publicly accessible to the outside
world.  In other words, the only repositories we are allowed should be
repositories that return aggregates.

NOTE: The rule that repositories should only return aggregates is the main place
    where we enforce the convention that aggregates are the only way into our
    domain model.  Be wary of breaking it!

In our case, we'll switch from `BatchRepository` to `ProductRepository`:


[[new_uow_and_repository]]

====
[source,python]

    def add(self, product):
        ...

    @abc.abstractmethod
    def get(self, sku) -> model.Product:
        ...
----
====

The ORM layer will need some tweaks so that the right batches automatically get
loaded and associated with `Product` objects. The nice thing is, the Repository
pattern means we don't have to worry about that yet. We can just use
our `FakeRepository` and then feed through the new model into our service
layer, to see how it looks with `Product` as its main entrypoint:

        ref: str, sku: str, qty: int, eta: Optional[date],

    with uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=sku)
        if product is None:
            product = model.Product(sku, batches=[])
            uow.products.add(product)
        product.batches.append(model.Batch(ref, sku, qty, eta))
        uow.commit()

        orderid: str, sku: str, qty: int,
        uow: unit_of_work.AbstractUnitOfWork
) -> str:
    line = OrderLine(orderid, sku, qty)
    with uow:
        product = uow.products.get(sku=line.sku)
        if product is None:
            raise InvalidSku(f'Invalid sku {line.sku}')
        batchref = product.allocate(line)
        uow.commit()
    return batchref
----
====

=== What About Performance?

We've mentioned a few times that we're modeling with aggregates because we want
to have high-performance software, but here we are loading _all_ the batches when
we only need one. You might expect that to be inefficient, but there are a few
reasons why we're comfortable here.

First, we're purposefully modeling our data so that we can make a single
query to the database to read, and a single update to persist our changes. This
tends to perform much better than systems that issue lots of ad-hoc queries. In
systems that don't model this way, we often find that transactions get slowly
longer and more complex as the software evolves.

Second, our data structures are minimal and comprise a few strings and
integers per row. We can easily load tens or even hundreds of batches in a few
milliseconds.

Third, we only expect to have 20 or so batches of each product at a time.
Once a batch is used up, we can discount it from our calculations. This means
that the amount of data we're fetching shouldn't get out of control over time.

If we _did_ expect to have thousands of active batches for a product, we'd have
a couple of options. For one, we could use lazy-loading for the batches in a
product. From the perspective of our code, nothing would change, but in the
background, SQLAlchemy would page through data for us. This would lead to more
requests, each fetching a smaller number of rows. Because we only need to find a
single batch with enough capacity for our order, this might work pretty well.

If all else failed, we'd just look for a different aggregate. Maybe we could
split up batches by region, or by warehouse. Maybe we could redesign our data
access strategy around the shipment concept. The Aggregate pattern is designed
to help manage some technical constraints around consistency and performance.
There isn't _one_ correct Aggregate, and we should feel comfortable changing our
minds if find our boundaries are causing performance woes.

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
.Exercise for the Reader
******************************************************************************
You've just seen the main top layers of the code, so this shouldn't be too hard,
but we'd like you to implement the `Product` aggregate starting from `Batch`,
just as we did.

Of course, you could cheat and copy/paste from the previous listings, but even
if you do that, you'll still have to solve a few challenges on your own,
like adding the model to the ORM and making sure all the moving parts can
talk to each other, which we hope will be instructive.

You'll find the code https://github.com/cosmicpython/code/tree/chapter_07_aggregate_exercise[on GitHub]. We've put in a "cheating" implementation in the delegates to the existing
`allocate()` function, so you should be able to evolve that toward the real
thing.

We've marked a couple of tests with `@pytest.skip()`. Come back to them
when you're done and you've read the rest of this chapter, to have a go
at implementing version numbers. Bonus points if you can get SQLAlchemy to
do them for you by magic!

******************************************************************************


=== Optimistic Concurrency with Version Numbers

We have our new aggregate, so we've solved the conceptual problem of choosing
an object to be in charge of consistency boundaries.  Let's now spend a little
time talking about how to enforce data integrity at the database level.

NOTE: This section has a lot of implementation details, some of which are Postgres-specific, for example. But more generally, we're showing
    one approach to managing concurrency issues, but it's just one approach.
    Real requirements in this area vary a lot from project to project. You
    shouldn't expect to be able to copy and paste code from here into production.

We don't want to hold a lock over the entire `batches` table, but how will we
implement holding a lock over just the rows for a particular SKU?

One answer is to have a single attribute on the `Product` model that acts as a marker for
the whole state change being complete and to use it as the single resource
that concurrent workers can fight over. If two transactions read the
state of the world for `batches` at the same time, and both want to update
the `allocations` tables, we force both to also try to update the
`version_number` in the `products` table, in such a way that only one of them
can win and the world stays consistent.

TIP: Version numbers are just one way to implement optimistic locking. You
    could achieve the same thing by setting the Postgres transaction isolation
    level to `SERIALIZABLE`, but that often comes at a severe performance cost.
    Version numbers also make implicit concepts explicit.


<<version_numbers_sequence_diagram>> illustrates two concurrent
transactions doing their read operations at the same time, so they see
a `Product` with, for example, `version=3`.  They both call `Product.allocate()`
in order to modify a state. But we set up our database integrity
rules such that only one of them is allowed to `commit` the new `Product`
with `version=4`, and the other update will be rejected.

[role="nobreakinside less_space"]
.Optimistic Concurrency Control and Retries
********************************************************************************

What we've implemented here is called _optimistic_ concurrency control because
our default assumption is that everything will be fine when two users want to
make changes to the database. We think it's unlikely that they will conflict
with each other, so we let them go ahead and just make sure we have a way to
notice if there was a problem.

_Pessimistic_ concurrency control works under the assumption that two users
are going to cause conflicts, and we want to prevent them in all cases, so
we lock everything just to be safe. In our example, that would mean locking
the whole `batches` table, or using ++SELECT FOR UPDATE++—we're pretending
that we've ruled those out for performance reasons, but in real life you'd
want to do some evaluations and measurements of your own.

With pessimistic locking, you don't need to think about handling failures
because the database will prevent them for you (although you do need to think
about deadlocks). With optimistic locking, you do need to explicitly handle
the possibility of failures in the (hopefully unlikely) case of a clash.

The usual way to handle a failure is to retry the failed operation from the
beginning. Imagine we have two customers, Harry and Bob, and both submit orders
for `SHINY-TABLE`. Both threads load the product at version 1 and allocate
stock. The database prevents the concurrent update, and Bob's order fails with
an error. When we _retry_ the operation, Bob's order loads the product at
version 2, and tries to allocate again. If there is enough stock left, all is
well; otherwise, he'll receive `OutOfStock`. Most operations can be retried this
way in the case of a concurrency problem.

Read more on retries in <<recovering_from_errors>> and <<footguns>>.
********************************************************************************


==== Implementation Options for Version Numbers

There are essentially three options for implementing version numbers:

1. `version_number` lives in the domain; we add it to the `Product` constructor,
   and `Product.allocate()` is responsible for incrementing it.

2. The services layer could do it!  The version number isn't _strictly_ a domain
   concern, so instead our service layer could assume that the current version number
   is attached to `Product` by the repository, and the service layer will increment it
   before it does the `commit()`.

3. Since it's arguably an infrastructure concern, the UoW and repository
   could do it by magic.  The repository has access to version numbers for any
   products it retrieves, and when the UoW does a commit, it can increment the
   version number for any products it knows about, assuming them to have changed.

Option 3 isn't ideal, because there's no real way of doing it without having to
assume that _all_ products have changed, so we'll be incrementing version numbers
when we don't have to.footnote:[Perhaps we could get some ORM/SQLAlchemy magic to tell
us when an object is dirty, but how would that work in the generic case; e.g., for a
CsvRepository?]

Option 2 involves mixing the responsibility for mutating state between the service
layer and the domain layer, so it's a little messy as well.

So in the end, even though version numbers don't _have_ to be a domain concern,
you might decide the cleanest trade-off is to put them in the domain.

        except StopIteration:
            raise OutOfStock(f'Out of stock for sku {line.sku}')
----
====

<1> There it is!

TIP: If you're scratching your head at this version number business, it might
    help to remember that the _number_ isn't important. What's important is
    that the `Product` database row is modified whenever we make a change to the
    `Product` aggregate. The version number is a simple human-comprehensible way
    to model a thing that changes on every write, but it could equally be a
    random UUID every time.


=== Testing for Our Data Integrity Rules

Now to make sure we can get the behavior we want: if we have two
concurrent attempts to do allocation against the same `Product`, one of them
should fail, because they can't both update the version number.

First let's simulate a "slow" transaction using a function that does
allocation, and then does an explicit sleep:footnote:[`time.sleep()` works well
in our use case, but it's not the most reliable or efficient way to reproduce
concurrency bugs.  Consider using semaphores or similar synchronization primitives
shared between your threads to get better guarantees of behavior.]

    try:
        with unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork() as uow:
            product = uow.products.get(sku=sku)
            product.allocate(line)

Then we have our test invoke this slow allocation twice, concurrently, using
threads:

.An integration test for concurrency behavior (tests/integration/test_uow.py)

def test_concurrent_updates_to_version_are_not_allowed(postgres_session_factory):
    sku, batch = random_sku(), random_batchref()
    session = postgres_session_factory()
    insert_batch(session, batch, sku, 100, eta=None, product_version=1)
    session.commit()

    order1, order2 = random_orderid(1), random_orderid(2)
    exceptions = []  # type: List[Exception]
    try_to_allocate_order1 = lambda: try_to_allocate(order1, sku, exceptions)
    try_to_allocate_order2 = lambda: try_to_allocate(order2, sku, exceptions)
    thread1 = threading.Thread(target=try_to_allocate_order1)  #<1>
    thread2 = threading.Thread(target=try_to_allocate_order2)  #<1>
    thread1.start()
    thread2.start()
    thread1.join()
    thread2.join()

    [[version]] = session.execute(
        "SELECT version_number FROM products WHERE sku=:sku",
        dict(sku=sku),
    )
    assert version == 2  #<2>
    [exception] = exceptions
    assert 'could not serialize access due to concurrent update' in str(exception)  #<3>

    orders = list(session.execute(
        "SELECT orderid FROM allocations"
        " JOIN batches ON allocations.batch_id = batches.id"
        " JOIN order_lines ON allocations.orderline_id = order_lines.id"
        " WHERE order_lines.sku=:sku",
        dict(sku=sku),
    ))
    assert len(orders) == 1  #<4>
    with unit_of_work.SqlAlchemyUnitOfWork() as uow:
        uow.session.execute('select 1')
----
====

<1> We start two threads that will reliably produce the concurrency behavior we
    want: `read1, read2, write1, write2`.

<2> We assert that the version number has been incremented only once.

<3> We can also check on the specific exception if we like.

<4> And we double-check that only one allocation has gotten through.



==== Enforcing Concurrency Rules by Using Database Transaction pass:[<span class="keep-together">Isolation Levels</span>]

To get the test to pass as it is, we can set the transaction isolation level
on our session:

[[isolation_repeatable_read]]
.Set isolation level for session (src/allocation/service_layer/unit_of_work.py)
====
[source,python]
----
DEFAULT_SESSION_FACTORY = sessionmaker(bind=create_engine(
    config.get_postgres_uri(),
    isolation_level="REPEATABLE READ",
))
----
====

Transaction isolation levels are tricky stuff, so it's worth spending time
understanding https://oreil.ly/5vxJA[the Postgres documentation].footnote:[If you're not using Postgres, you'll need to read different documentation. Annoyingly, different databases all have quite different definitions. Oracle's `SERIALIZABLE` is equivalent to Postgres's `REPETABLE READ`, for pass:[<span class="keep-together">example</span>].]

==== Pessimistic Concurrency Control Example: SELECT FOR UPDATE

There are multiple ways to approach this, but we'll show one. https://oreil.ly/i8wKL[`SELECT FOR UPDATE`],
produces different behavior; two concurrent transactions will not be allowed to
do a read on the same rows at the same time:

`SELECT FOR UPDATE` is a way of picking a row or rows to use as a lock
(although those rows don't have to be the ones you update).  If two
transactions both try to `SELECT FOR UPDATE` a row at the same time, one will
win, and the other will wait until the lock is released. So this is an example
of pessimistic concurrency control.

Here's how you can use the SQLAlchemy DSL to specify `FOR UPDATE` at
query time:

[[with_for_update]]
.SQLAlchemy with_for_update (src/allocation/adapters/repository.py)
====
[source,python]
[role="non-head"]
----
    def get(self, sku):
        return self.session.query(model.Product) \
                           .filter_by(sku=sku) \
                           .with_for_update() \
                           .first()
----
====


This will have the effect of changing the concurrency pattern from

[role="skip"]
----
read1, read2, write1, write2(fail)
----

to

[role="skip"]
----
read1, write1, read2, write2(succeed)
----

Some people refer to this as the "read-modify-write" failure mode.
Read https://oreil.ly/uXeZI["PostgreSQL Anti-Patterns: Read-Modify-Write Cycles"] for a good overview.

//TODO maybe better diagrams here?

We don't really have time to discuss all the trade-offs between `REPEATABLE READ`
and `SELECT FOR UPDATE`, or optimistic versus pessimistic locking in general.
But if you have a test like the one we've shown, you can specify the behavior
you want and see how it changes. You can also use the test as a basis for
performing some performance experiments.



=== Aggregates Wrap-up

Specific choices around concurrency control vary a lot based on business
circumstances and storage technology choices, but we'd like to bring this
chapter back to the conceptual idea of an Aggregate: we explicitly model an
object as being the main entrypoint to some subset of our model, and to be in
charge of enforcing the invariants and business rules that apply across all of
those objects.

Choosing the right aggregate is key, and it's a decision you may revisit
over time. You can read more about it in multiple DDD books.
We also recommend these three online papers on
https://dddcommunity.org/library/vernon_2011[Effective Aggregate Design]
by Vaugh Vernon (the "red book" author).

.Aggregates and Consistency Boundaries Recap
*****************************************************************
Aggregates are your entrypoints into the domain model::
    By restricting the number of ways that things can be changed,
    we make the system easier to reason about.

Aggregates are in charge of a consistency boundary::
    An aggregate's job is to be able to manage our business rules
    about invariants as they apply to a group of related objects.
    It's the aggregate's job to check that the objects within its
    remit are consistent with each other and with our rules, and
    to reject changes that would break the rules.

Aggregates and concurrency issues go together::
    When thinking about implementing these consistency checks, we
    end up thinking about transactions and locks.  Choosing the
    right aggregate is about performance as well as conceptual
    organization of your domain.

*****************************************************************

<<chapter_07_aggregate_tradoffs>> has some thoughts on the trade-offs of implementing the Aggregate pattern.

.Aggregates: the trade-offs
|===
|Pros|Cons
a|
* Python might not have "official" public and private methods, but we do have
  the underscores convention, because it's often useful to try to indicate what's for
  "internal" use and what's for "outside code" to use. Choosing aggregates is
  just the next level up: it lets you decide which of your domain model classes
  are the public ones, and which aren't.

* Modeling our operations around explicit consistency boundaries helps us avoid
  performance problems with our ORM.

* Putting the aggregate in sole charge of state changes to its subsidiary models
  makes the system easier to reason about, and makes it easier to control invariants.

a|
* Yet another new concept for new developers to take on. Explaining entities versus
  value objects was already a mental load; now there's a third type of domain
  model object?

* Sticking rigidly to the rule that we modify only one aggregate at a time is a
  big mental shift.

* Dealing with eventual consistency between aggregates can be complex.

=== Part One Recap

Do you remember <<recap_components_diagram>>, the diagram we showed at the
beginning of the book to preview where we were heading?

[[recap_components_diagram]]
.A component diagram for our app at the end of Part One

So that's where we are, at the end of part one. What have we achieved? We've
seen how to build a domain model that's exercised by a set of
high-level unit tests. Our tests are living documentation: they describe the
behavior of our system--the rules that we agreed with our business
stakeholders--in nice readable code. When our business requirements change, we
have confidence that our tests will help us to prove the new functionality, and
when new developers join the project, they can read our tests to understand how
things work.

We've decoupled the infrastructural parts of our system, like the database and
API handlers, so that we can plug them into the outside of our application.
This helps us to keep our codebase well organized, and stops us from building a
big ball of mud.

By applying the dependency inversion principle, and by using the ports-and-adapters
inspired patterns like Repository and Unit of Work, we've made it possible to
do TDD in both high gear and low gear, and to maintain a healthy test pyramid.
We can test our system edge-to-edge, and the need for integration and
end-to-end tests is kept to a minimum.

Lastly, we've talked about the idea of consistency boundaries. We don't want to
lock our entire system whenever we make a change, so we have to choose which
parts are consistent with one another.

For a small system, this is everything you need to go and play with the ideas of
Domain-Driven Design. You now have the tools to build database agnostic domain
models that represent the shared language of your business experts. Hurrah!

NOTE: At the risk of laboring the point--we've been at pains to point out that
    each pattern comes at a cost. Each layer of indirection has a price in terms
    of complexity and duplication in our code, and will be confusing to programmers
    who've never seen them before. If your app is essentially a simple CRUD
    wrapper around a database, and isn't likely to be anything more than that
    in the forseeable future, _you don't need these patterns_. Go ahead and
    use Django, and save yourself a lot of bother.

In part two, we'll zoom out and talk about a bigger topic: if aggregates are our
boundary, and we can only update one at a time, how do we model processes that
cross consistency boundaries?
